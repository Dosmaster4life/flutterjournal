# Overview

Welcome to FlutterJournal, a perfect app for a private journal

FlutterJournal is a safe secure journal that only stores data on your device. You can write Journal Entries with ease
and confidence no one will be stealing your data.

I made this app to help people have a free and open source journal to use.
